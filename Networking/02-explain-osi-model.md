### Explain the complete flow of a request from client to server using the OSI Model.

This question checks if you understand how a network request travels across layers — from user input in a browser to reaching a remote server — using the 7 layers of the OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) Model.

- The OSI Model has 7 layers, and each layer plays a specific role in transferring data from a client (like a browser) to a server (like a web server).

## Detailed Explanation

1. Application Layer (Layer 7)
- You type https://example.com in a browser.
- The browser creates an HTTP request.
- This request goes through the application layer using protocols like HTTP, HTTPS, or FTP.
    - 🧠 Key Protocols: HTTP, HTTPS, DNS, FTP, SMTP

2. Presentation Layer (Layer 6)
- Ensures the data is in the right format.
- Handles encryption (SSL/TLS) and compression.
- 🧠 Example: HTTPS encryption starts here.

3. Session Layer (Layer 5)
- Manages session establishment between client and server.
- Keeps track of connections so that sessions can resume or timeout gracefully.
    - 🧠 Think of it as opening and maintaining a conversation between two devices.

4. Transport Layer (Layer 4)
- Breaks data into segments and ensures reliable delivery.
- Adds source and destination port numbers.
- 🧠 Key Protocols: TCP (reliable), UDP (faster but no guarantee)

- Example: HTTP usually uses TCP port 80, HTTPS uses TCP port 443.

5. Network Layer (Layer 3)
- Adds source and destination IP addresses.
- Chooses the best route for the packet across the internet.
- 🧠 Key Protocol: IP (Internet Protocol)

6. Data Link Layer (Layer 2)
- Converts data into frames.
- Adds MAC addresses of the devices on a local network.
- Handles error detection and physical addressing.
    - 🧠 Example: Ethernet/Wi-Fi protocol operates here.

7. Physical Layer (Layer 1)
- Transfers raw bits (0s and 1s) over physical hardware like cables, Wi-Fi signals, or fiber optics.
- Example: Electrical signals, radio waves, fiber optics

### Summary:
The OSI model helps us understand how data flows across a network. It breaks the process into layers so we can troubleshoot and build systems more effectively. Each layer wraps or unwraps data, guiding it from your browser to a server — and back.
